Katkatha is a puppet theatre group in India. Their contemporary form of puppetry is based on the principle that the puppeteer can breathe life into any object and turn it into a puppet. At the same time, they draw from Bunraku, Togalu Gombeyaata, Kalaripayattu, and other traditional techniques of puppetry and movement.

I worked with them the summer after graduating from college and helped them document the development of their newest show, an adaptaion of the <i>Mahabharata</i>. I shadowed their rehearsals; learned about puppetry, movement, folklore; took photographs; wrote a blog for them; and designed a website for them.

Read the <a href="http://shreshthkhilani.github.io/KatkathaMahabharata/" target="_blank">blog</a> in which I compare them to CÃ©zanne.
