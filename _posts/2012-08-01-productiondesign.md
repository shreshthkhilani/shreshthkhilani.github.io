Paper Faces Theatre was a group that I co-founded while on a year off between high school and college. While on my gap year, I spearheaded a production of *Sweeney Todd* and then in the summer after freshman year, we produced Neel Chaudhuri's *Taramandal*.

#### *Taramandal* by Neel Chaudhuri, Summer 2012

After doing a string of musicals in high school and beyond, I wanted to work with real shows written by Indian playwrights. *Taramandal* adapts Satyajit Ray's short story *Patol Babu Film Star* and adds other short scenes of Indians who want to be a star, but probably won't be.
