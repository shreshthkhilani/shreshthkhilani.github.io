The Narrator was just broken up with. As he walks down the streets of Brooklyn, he is convinced that his command on words, ideas, philosophy, and cooking will help him heal his loss, anxiety, and loneliness. At the same time, the Yarn Spinner sits in a cafe, overflowing. She reflects on embodiment, recipes, and flotation as she tries to piece together fragments of her unravelling memory. 

The Narrator tells his story through a radio narrative woven together with the Yarn Spinnerâ€™s danced experiences in the space. The room, infused with dreams and magic will be open to an intimate audience of eight. You will be invited to sip coffee and feed off these recipes of unravelling and healing.

Cabbage Head is a work-in-progress and will continue to grow. The next showing is in January 2018. Follow <a href="https://fb.me/atatticspace" target="_blank">At Attic</a> on Facebook or <a href="https://instagram.com/atatticspace" target="_blank">@atatticspace</a> on Instagram to know more.
