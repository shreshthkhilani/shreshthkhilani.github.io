Within a couple of years at Penn, I worked as a scenic designer for PenNaatak, Penn Players, iNtuitons, and the African American Arts Alliance.

#### Advanced Scenic Design and Drafting (Independent Study with Professor Peter Whinnery), Spring 2016

At Penn, I took a Scenic Design Independent Study with Peter Whinnery. I learned tool used for drafting: how to draw ground plans, sections, front elevations, and paint elevations. I also continued to use Google's SketchUp for 3D rendering. I desgined a realist set for Lisa D'Amour's *Detroit*, a surreal and graffiti-ridden set for Philip Ridley's *Mercury Fur*, and a Bowie-esque sterile stable for Peter Shaffer's *Equus*.

#### *The Big Fat City* by Mahesh Dattani, Fall 2015

My last show as scenic designer for PenNaatak was for a Mahesh Dattani's newest show. *The Big Fat City* is about contemporary city life in Mumbai: financial struggles, lies, false niceties. The show slowly stretches the characters until breaking point where the audience is sharply reminded of the social evils still present in India today. My set was an entire one-bedroom apartment box on stage, with the beams and framework of the apartment intact. This provided the lighting designer with tools to cast harsh shadows on stage when the play takes a turn for the Kafkaesque. 

#### *The Who & The What* by Ayad Akhtar, Spring 2015

Ayad Akhtar's show about a Pakistani family in Atlanta made me think about the art and architecture choices of the father, a middle-aged Pakistani immigrant, versus the younger Eli, a white Muslim convert raised on Malcolm X's teachings. This made me explore and contrast their generational and class differences through the scenic design.

#### *Tara* by Mahesh Dattani, Fall 2014

I for some reason never found the time to take pictures of this set, although it was one of my favorites. A corrupt administration represented by a doctor always on stage was given a ten-foot high pedestal to tower over the characters stuck in a Kafkaesque system. The floor was painted with a false shadow of the wooden frame of the ten-foot platform. The doctor has left after the surgery to seperate the twins, but the scars can never leave the life of the characters Tara and Chandan.

#### *The Bluest Eye* by Toni Morrison, Fall 2014

I worked with the African American Arts Alliance on their production of The Bluest Eye. Central to the scenic design was a tree of memories. Imagery referred to in the show, props, fabrics were hung from this tree of bent pipes.

#### *Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo* by Rajiv Joseph, Spring 2014

Rajiv Joseph is one of my favorite playwrights. The director wanted to talk about the spirituality and sanctity of human life within this war torn city. The scenic design represented that by putting a carpeted mosque-like are within elements of grime, concrete, graffitied walls.
