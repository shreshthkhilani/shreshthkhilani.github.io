Fun comes first.

Fun is for all.

Fun can have structure.

Fun is a collection of one-things.

The show explores Andrew and Shreshth's relationship, communication, self-aware masculinity, queerness, and playful competitiveness. 

Passion Fruit Dances is all about having fun. It builds an immersive experience while finding a way to make audience members creative participants in the performance. 

The weekly performance happens at 7pm on Sundays. Follow us on <a href="https://fb.me/passionfruitdances" target="_blank">Facebook</a> to know more.
