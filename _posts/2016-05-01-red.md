Easily the show I'm most proud of having worked on, Red was an experiment in realism and intimacy. I wanted to talk about art without distancing the viewer from the creation and the creative process. So, with a team of wonderfully talented actors and designers, we invited the audience into Penn's wood shop, which we turned into Mark Rothko's studio.

Working in a four-person rehearsal room gave us the flexibility to really dig in to character early on in the process. We worked to build a general narrative arc, and specific character arcs. As the director, I then helped usher all the elements to come together and contribute to that vision. If we had conersations about the cyclic nature of art, I'd think of how that could be incorporated in the physicality of the actors, in the lighting changes, in the costumes.
