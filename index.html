    <p>Hi, I'm Shreshth! <small>(Pronouns: he/him. Phonetic pronunciation: sh-ray-sh-T.)</small></p>
    <p>I went to Penn and majored in Computer Science, but also did a whole bunch of student theatre. I designed scenery for shows like Ayad Akhtar's <i>The Who and the What</i>, Rajiv Joseph's <i>The Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo</i>, and Mahesh Dattani's <i>Tara</i>. I also directed a production of John Logan's <i>Red</i>, which was performed in an intimate and realist space, Penn's wood workshop, to immerse the audience into the creation and the creative process.</p>
    <p>Eager to learn what lies beyond traditional, realist, text-first theatre, I spent the summer of 2016 working with a devised contemporary puppet theatre, <a href="http://katkatha.org" target="_blank">Katkatha</a>, in New Delhi. Working with a strict movement vocabulary and a devising process, Katkatha inspired me to explore experiential performance art. I worked with the <a href="http://www.headlongperformanceinstitute.org/" target="_blank">Headlong Performance Institute</a> in Philadelphia in 2017 to further push my boundaries and challenge my conceptions of what art is.</p>
    <p>I am interested in telling real stories of love, distance, illness, and food through a magical and dreamy lens. This magic leads me to draw from Indian mythology and folklore, and fuels my interest in traditional forms of Indian art making.</p>
    <p>Some of the projects I'm currently working on are below.</p>
    <p><a href="/cabbagehead"><i>Cabbage Head</i></a> is a radio narrative that is woven together with an experiential dance performance made for a small audience in an imtimate space. The show talks about love, loss, healing, tenderness in masculinity, and food. I wrote it, performed in it, and co-created it with Sarah Marks Mininsohn.</p>
    <p><a href="/passionfruitdances"><i>Passion Fruit Dances</i></a> is a weekly performance series that happens every Sunday. Andrew Roetman and I created it, perform in it, and have a lot of fun along the way. It explores fun, our relationship, queerness, and masculinity while it tries to figure out ways in which to create fun performances in conjunction with an audience.</p>
    <p>I'm also writing a yet to be titled narrative in sonnets and beyond. Stories of immigration, family, borders, and disease are simmering in me and one can only guess how they will mature. A novel in verse? A dance performance? A poetry reading? All of these things?</p>
