    <p>Hi, I'm Shreshth! <small>(Pronouns: he/him. Phonetic pronunciation: sh-ray-sh-T.)</small></p>
    <p>I went to Penn and majored in Computer Science, but also did a whole bunch of student theatre. I designed scenery for shows like Ayad Akhtar's <i>The Who and the What</i>, Rajiv Joseph's <i>The Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo</i>, and Mahesh Dattani's <i>Tara</i>. I also directed a production of John Logan's <i>Red</i>, which was performed in an intimate and realist space, Penn's wood workshop, to immerse the audience into the creation and the creative process.</p>
    <p>Eager to learn what lies beyond traditional, realist, text-first theatre, I spent the summer of 2016 working with a devised contemporary puppet theatre, <a href="http://katkatha.org" target="_blank">Katkatha</a>, in New Delhi. Working with a strict movement vocabulary and a devising process, Katkatha inspired me to explore experiential performance art. I worked with the <a href="http://www.headlongperformanceinstitute.org/" target="_blank">Headlong Performance Institute</a> in Philadelphia in 2017 to further push my boundaries and challenge my conceptions of what art is.</p>
    <p>I am interested in telling real stories of love, distance, illness, and food through a magical and dreamy lens. This magic leads me to draw from Indian mythology and folklore, and fuels my interest in traditional forms of Indian art making.</p>
    <p>Some of the projects I'm currently working on are below.</p>
    <p><i>Cabbage Head</i> is a radio narrative that is woven together with an experiential dance performance made for a small audience in an imtimate space. The show talks about love, loss, healing, tenderness in masculinity, and food. I wrote it, performed in it, and co-created it with Sarah Marks Mininsohn.</p>
    <p><i>Passion Fruit Dances</i> is a weekly performance series that happens every Sunday. Andrew Roetman and I created it, perform in it, and have a lot of fun along the way. It explores fun, our relationship, queerness, and masculinity while it tries to figure out ways in which to create fun performances in conjunction with an audience.</p>
    <p>I'm also writing a yet to be titled narrative in sonnets and beyond. Stories of immigration, family, borders, and disease are simmering in me and one can only guess how they will mature. A novel in verse? A dance performance? A poetry reading? All of these things?</p>

    <h2 id="hi">Hi</h2>

    <p>Hi, I'm Shreshth (pronounced: sh-ray-sh-T). I make art.</p>
    
    {% include image.html url="/images/bench-li.JPG" site="y" caption="Spot me on a bench by a coffee shop;<br>To say hello, won't you stop?" %}
    <p>I'm currently enrolled in the Headlong Performance Institue where I'm learning and making art with a group of very talented artists. One could attend our open salons or our final show if one was interested.</p>

    <h2 id="theatre-positions">Theatre Positions</h2>

    <p>Here are some positions I've held in organizations that I'm particularly proud of. </p>
      <h4>Documentation Intern, <a href="http://katkatha.org/">Katkatha Puppet Arts Trust</a>, New Delhi, August 2016</h4>
      <p>Katkatha is a puppet theatre group in India. Their contemporary form of puppetry is based on the principle that the puppeteer can breathe life into any object and turn it into a puppet. At the same time, they draw from Bunraku, Togalu Gombeyaata, Kalaripayattu, and other traditional techniques of puppetry and movement.</p>
      <p>I worked with them the summer after graduating from college and helped them document the development of their newest show, an adaptaion of the <i>Mahabharata</i>. I shadowed their rehearsals; learned about puppetry, movement, folklore; took photographs; wrote a blog for them; and designed a website for them.</p>
      <p>Read the <a href="{{ site.url }}/KatkathaMahabharata">blog</a> in which I compare them to Cézanne.</p>
      {% include image.html url="/images/katkatha.JPG" site="y" caption="Katkatha depicts the death of Abhimanyu,<br>With choreography inspired by Kalaripayattu." %}
      <p></p>

      <h4>Chair, PenNaatak Theatre, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 seasons</h4>
      <p>Being on the board of a theatre group for three years (chair for two) gave me a lot of insight into the work it takes to actually put a show together. The vision I had for creating a space to bring new shows from all around the globe to Penn brought us to open Naatak's mission statement up. By the time I graduated, PenNaatak went from being Penn's South Asian theatre group to Penn's only Global Contemporary theatre group.</p>

      <h4>Board Member, One Acts Festival, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, 2014 and 2015</h4>
      <p>Penn's One Acts Festival was a great platform to encourage people to try new things and I was happy to be a part of it as Tech Director in 2014 and as Vice Chair and Assistant Producer in 2015.</p>

      <h4>Co-founder, Paper Faces Theatre, Kolkata, 2011</h4>
      <p>I took a year off before heading to college and worked with two extremely talented friends to start a little theatre company in Kolkata. Together, we produced and directed two shows: Stephen Sondheim's <i>Sweeney Todd</i> in 2011 and Neel Chaudhuri's <i>Taramandal</i> in 2012.</p>

    <h2 id="direction">Direction</h2>
      <h4>Director, <i>Red</i> by John Logan, Philadelphia, April 2016</h4>
      <p>Easily the show I'm most proud of having worked on, <i>Red</i> was an experiment in realism and intimacy. I wanted to talk about art without distancing the viewer from the creation and the creative process. So, with a team of wonderfully talented actors and designers, we invited the audience into Penn's wood shop, which we turned into Mark Rothko's studio.</p>
      <p>Working in a four-person rehearsal room gave us the flexibility to really dig in to character early on in the process. We worked to build a general narrative arc, and specific character arcs. As the director, I then helped usher all the elements to come together and contribute to that vision. If we had conersations about the cyclic nature of art, I'd think of how that could be incorporated in the physicality of the actors, in the lighting changes, in the costumes. </p>

      <p></p>
      <h4>Director, <i>Taramandal</i> by Neel Chaudhuri, Philadelphia, November 2013</h4>
      <p></p>

    <h2 id="scenic-design">Scenic Design</h2>
      <h4>Scenic Designer, <i>The Who &amp; The What</i> by Ayad Akhtar, Philadelphia, Spring 2015</h4>
      <p>Ayad Akhtar's show about a Pakistani family in Atlanta made me think about the art and architecture choices of the father, a middle-aged Pakistani immigrant, versus the younger Eli, a white Muslim convert raised on Malcolm X's teachings. This made me explore and contrast their generational and class differences through the scenic design.</p>
      {% include image.html url="/images/whowhat-1.jpg" site="y" caption="Elaborate Islamic patterns are attempted; <br>The father's house is well presented." %}
      {% include imageright.html url="/images/whowhat-2.JPG" site="y" caption="Eli and Zarina's house is in similar element; <br>Painted on arch, on tiles no money is spent." %}
      <p></p>
      <h4>Scenic Designer, <i>Tara</i> by Mahesh Dattani, Philadelphia, Fall 2015</h4>
      <p>I for some reason never found the time to take pictures of this set, although it was one of my favorites. A corrupt administration represented by a doctor always on stage was given a ten-foot high pedestal to tower over the characters stuck in a Kafkaesque system. The floor was painted with a false shadow of the wooden frame of the ten-foot platform. The doctor has left after the surgery to seperate the twins, but the scars can never leave the life of the characters Tara and Chandan.</p>
      <h4>Scenic Designer and Stage Manager, <i>Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo</i> by Rajiv Joseph, Philadelphia, Spring 2014</h4>
      <p>Rajiv Joseph is one of my favorite playwrights. The director wanted to talk about the spirituality and sanctity of human life within this war torn city. The scenic design represented that by putting a carpeted mosque-like are within elements of grime, concrete, graffitied walls.</p>
